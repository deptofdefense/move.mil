# Seeds Data

This folder contains the static data for the database needed for the site to function. It does not include any dynamic data.

# Ranks and Entitlements

The weight entitlements by rank name are found in `entitlements.yml`. This information comes from the DTR, Part IV, Appendix K-1.

# ZIP3 to ZIP3 distances from DTOD

## Generating the input

`zip3_dtod.rake` is a Rake task that generates a two-column, space-delimited list of ZIP3 pairs, useful for submitting batches of distance requests to the [Defense Table of Official Distances a.k.a. DTOD](https://dtod.sddc.army.mil).

If a new ZIP3 prefix enters or leaves service with the USPS, just alter the zip3 array in zip3_dtod.py accordingly, and regenerate the output by running

`$ bin/rails admin:zip3_dtod | split -l 174762 -`

This will make several files with filenames starting with `xa`. Why pipe the output to split? As of this writing, DTOD's batch distance processing tool limits uploads to 2 MiB. 174762 lines * 12 bytes per line = 2097144 bytes, just under 2 MiB.

## Uploading the input

Once you have generated the input files, go to the [Calculate Distances -> Batch Processing page on DTOD](https://dtod.sddc.army.mil/Content/CalculateDistances/Batch.aspx) and complete the form.

 * **File Request Contact Information:** I put in my mail.mil e-mail address; I do not know if the tool believes a dds.mil address is a "valid government e-mail address."
 * **Data Input Type:** ZipCode
 * **Route Options:** 1. North America, 2. DITY, 3. Miles

Upload each input file, one per iteration of the form. You do not need to wait for the previous batch to finish before submitting the next one. However, it does take DTOD a while to churn through hundreds of thousands of ZIP3 pairs, so expect to wait multiple hours.

## Collecting the output

Once DTOD has sent you all of the results, concatenate them together and write them to `zip3_dtod_output.csv`. Join the files in the same order that they were generated. The database doesn't care, but it will make the git diff shorter.

# 400NG Baseline Rates

Each year's domestic Baseline Rates file from SDDC can be found on their [Personal Property->Household Goods page](https://www.sddc.army.mil/pp/Pages/houseGoods.aspx), under the "Special Requirements and Rates Team -> Domestic" tab. Rates for each year (to take effect on May 15 of that year) are published in December of the previous year.

As the maximum entitlement is 20500 lbs (O-10 w/ progear), there is currently no logic for calculating costs at 24000 lbs and beyond, and the "each addl CWT" columns from the original spreadsheet are all ignored.

## Preparing a new 400NG Baseline Rates for inclusion

SDDC publishes the 400NG tables in an Excel file, but it's not very clean. Cleaning it up reduces the time it takes to import from roughly 30 seconds to under a second, with dramatically lower RAM usage as well.

To clean it up:

1. Open the file in Excel. Ignore links to other documents.
1. In each sheet, select the first empty column to the right of all content.
1. Select all columns from there to the end. On Macs, this is done by pressing "Shift + Command + (right arrow)."
1. Edit->Delete
1. Select the first empty row below all content.
1. Select all rows from there to the end. On Macs, this is done by pressing "Shift + Command + (down arrow)."
1. Edit->Delete
1. Once you have removed the extraneous garbage from each sheet, save the file and drop it in `db/seeds`. It should have dropped in size from over 6 MiB to less than than 200 KiB.

Now you can add the new year's baseline rates to `seeds.rb`.

# Discounts from top TSP (by BVS) by channel

The list of discounts by channel, corresponding to the top TSP's discount filed during the previous rate-filing cycle, is used to generate PPM estimates. These discounts are trade secrets, so this data needs to be encrypted so that it is not stored in the clear on GitHub.

## Encrypting discounts file for a new TDL

Each discount list only applies to a single TDL (tonnage distribution list), so in practice, only for a few months. As new lists are generated, they need to be encrypted, put in the `db/seeds/` folder, and loaded in `seeds.rb`.

The encryption command is:

`openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -iv $SEEDS_ENC_IV -K $SEEDS_ENC_KEY -in (input) -out (output.enc)`

# free_zipcode_data

To lookup the city / state and geographic centroid coordinates of ZIP codes, we rely on data collected and published by the [`free_zipcode_data` project on GitHub](https://github.com/midwire/free_zipcode_data/). If you wish to update any of this data, simply go to [`free_zipcode_data`'s project page](https://github.com/midwire/free_zipcode_data/) and replace our copy of their CSV data with the latest version.
