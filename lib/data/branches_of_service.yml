    - title: Temporary Change of Station (TCS) Guidance
      effective_at: 20170525
      content: |
        <p>If you have a Temporary Change of Station (TCS) coming up, it is recommended that you visit your local property office for help arranging your move. They will be able to help you schedule your move and deal with the more complicated entitlements and accounting procedures than are typically associated with your normal Permanent Change of Station (PCS).</p>

    - title: Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)
      effective_at: 20180309
      content: |
        <p>Marines conducting a PCS move to, from or between OCONUS locations may be entitled to move or store their POV. Questions regarding eligibility for shipment or storage of POVs should first be forwarded to the local PPO.</p>
        <p>When storing a POV, Marines are reminded to obtain an authorization letter from the local PPO to store their POV when shipment to an OCONUS destination is not authorized. Marines must make a drop-off appointment with the Global POV Contractor, International Auto Logistics, at <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://www.pcsmypov.com/About">PCSMyPOV.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Prior to turn in, customers are responsible for ensuring their vehicle does not have an unresolved Recall Notice. Vehicle Owners can verify if their vehicles have a recall notice at the following link: <a class="usa-external_link" href="https://vinrcl.safercar.gov/vin/">https://vinrcl.safercar.gov/vin/</a>. Service members can also contact their servicing Vehicle Processing Center to determine if their particular vehicle will be accepted for shipment or storage. If there is a recall on a vehicle, owners must provide documented proof of repair by a certified mechanic dealership (authorized by the manufacturer).</p>
    - title: Move Date Selection

        <p>All Marines must provide Primary and Alternate move dates. There must be at least three (3) Government Business Days (GBD) between these dates.</p>
    - title: Avoid Popular Moving Dates When Possible
      effective_at: 20180309
      content: |
        <p>The most popular dates for moves during the peak moving season are just prior to Memorial Day through two weeks after the Fourth of July. Performing HHG moves during this window could present challenges with scheduling and the quality  of TSP/Moving Company performance. It is recommended that Marines complete their self-counseling and submit their Primary and Alternate move dates at least 90 days in advance of their Primary move date. Pickup dates should be planned to allow for flexibility when selecting dates to vacate housing, commence travel, and perform other PCS-related events.</p>
        <p>Note that the last two days and the first two days of every month are also particularly difficult dates for pickup since most leases and rental agreements start or end during that time. Final pack and pick-up dates are not confirmed until the conclusion of the pre-move survey (either in person or telephonically) conducted by a representative of the TSP/Moving Company. If personal circumstances require a change to the agreed upon pickup date, there is a substantial risk that new requested dates may not be available.</p>
