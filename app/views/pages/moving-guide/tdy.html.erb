      <h4>Shipping <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %> Household Goods</h4>
      <p>If you find yourself heading out on <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %> for an extended period of time (31 or more days), your Approving Official may authorize you to ship a small amount of household goods, to include some of your professional gear and medical equipment. Your <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %> shipment should be scheduled on the Defense Personal Property System (DPS) and as with any PCS visit your local Personal Property Office if you have any questions.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="weight_allowances">
      <h4>Weight Allowances for <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %> Shipments</h4>
      <p>The member's grade on the day travel begins determines which weight allowance is allowed.  The weight allowances below are in addition to any unaccompanied or accompanied baggage.  Furthermore, in the event the <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %> location becomes the permanent duty station, this would mean that the <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %> weight allowance would also be an additional allowance to any PCS weight entitlements.</p>

      <p>Check out the table below. You'll find out just how much you are allowed to ship to this location.</p>
