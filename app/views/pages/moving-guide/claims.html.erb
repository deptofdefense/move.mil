      While we hope all of your items arrived in one piece, the reality is that isn’t always the case. If you have any questions about this process, you can contact your <%= link_to 'Military Claims Office', page_path('customer-service', anchor: 'claims') %>.

      <p>If any of your household goods are lost or destroyed during the moving process, you are entitled to full replacement value of that item, assuming your claim is filed within the nine months following the date of delivery. <strong>All claims must be submitted on the <%= link_to 'Defense Personal Property System (DPS)', 'https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ETASSOPortal/default.aspx' %>, which is the portal your move originally was scheduled in.</strong> However, if you and your <%= abbr_tag('tsp') %> cannot reach a settlement for all or a portion of your claim, you can transfer that portion of your claim to your <%= link_to 'Military Claims Office', page_path('customer-service', anchor: 'claims') %> for processing.</p>

      <%= render layout: 'shared/pro_tip' do %>
        <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> You can only accept compensation for a single item once during the moving process, so be careful when you negotiate or accept payment with your transportation service provider. Sometimes, if something is immediately recognized as damaged on delivery, the moving company will offer you up to $500 that day, which is called a “quick claim”. If you accept that payment, you cannot file claims on those items later on to recieve the full replacement value.

      <h4 id="full-replacement-value">What does "Full Replacement" Value" mean?</h4>

      <p>When you are moving with the military, your items are insured at “Full Replacement Value” at no additional cost to the service family. Essentially, this means that if an item is lost or destroyed during the move, the carrier should pay to replace it with a like item. The replacement could be new, used, or if the item is damaged, repaired to fulfill the “Full Replacement Value” policy. The carrier will still require proof of the item's value and quality and will likely want evidence of the cost to replace it.</p>

    <div class="article-section">
      <h4 id="report">Loss &amp; Damage Report</h4>

      <p>A Loss/Damage Report allows you to notify the moving company of your intent to file a claim for missing or damaged items. <strong>Remember… a Loss/Damage Report is NOT a claim. You must still file a itemized claim to receive reimbursement!</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Damage found on Pack-Up/Delivery Day:</strong> If you notice any lost or damaged items on delivery day, you should ask the driver to complete and sign a DD1840 form. (The driver should have copies of this form on hand, but if you want to be super prepared, you can print a few copies yourself.) Of course you can always report these items after the fact, but the advantage of doing it on moving day is that both you and your transportation service provider (TSP) are agreeing that damage occured up front. That can lead to fewer disputes later on in the claims process and potentially higher settlements. If you and the driver complete a paper DD1840 form, a copy of this document must be uploaded to the <%= link_to 'Defense Personal Property System (DPS)', 'https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ETASSOPortal/default.aspx' %> within 30 days of your delivery date.</p>

        <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> If you file a Loss/Damage Report, you can submit claims for any additional lost or damaged items discovered after the initial 75 Day window… even if it wasn’t included on the original Loss/Damage Report. Contact your <%= abbr_tag('mco') %> to request a waiver and establish good cause for the delay. Good cause may include—but is not limited to—an officially recognized absense or hospitalization during some or all of the 75 days after delivery.

      <p>When you sign in to the <%= link_to 'Defense Personal Property System (DPS)', 'https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ETASSOPortal/default.aspx' %>, if you started with a Loss/Damage Report, you can export all the data you entered directly into the Claims system. If some of the items that were lost are now found, you can remove them before you submit the final claim.</p>

      <p>After you have submitted the claim to the moving company, they are responsible for obtaining repair estimates for any of the damaged or lost items. They may send out an adjuster to take a look at the item if it’s serious as well.</p>

      <p><strong>The moving company must pay, deny or make an offer within 60 days of the completed claim submission.</strong> You will have the opportunity to accept or reject the offer for each item that you have claimed. Remember, this is a negotiation, so if you are not happy with the offer, you should reject it.</p>

      <p>If you are unable to come to an agreement with the moving company, your next step is to transfer the claim to your <%= link_to 'Military Claims Office', page_path('customer-service', anchor: 'claims') %>. The Military Claims Office will take over from there but it’s important you stay in close contact with them throughout the process. As we stated from the start, you need to stay proactive throughout the process and it’s recommended you follow-up with the moving company and/or the Military Claims Office.</p>

      <%= render layout: 'shared/pro_tip' do %>
        <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> There is a misconception that the Military Claims Office only helps you get partial replacement value for your household goods. This is not the case. The Military Claims Office will pay out a partial replacement value and then continue to negotiate for the full replacement value on your behalf. If they are successful, you will get the full replacement value for the damaged item.

      <p>If your transportation service provider (TSP) causes any damage to your home or residence, you should contact your moving company directly and arrange for the damage to be fixed. An example of damage might include scratched hardwood floors, dented walls, torn grass, etc.</p>
      <p>If you have any problems negotiating settlement, you should contact your local legal office and seek assistance from a Legal Assistance Attorney. If you are not entitled to military legal services, you should consult with a local attorney.</p>
