        <p><strong>For separatees with less than 8 years of continuous active duty:</strong> The government will only pay the cost of moving your belongings to your Home of Record (HOR) or your Place Entering Active Duty (PLEAD).<p>
        <p>You can still move somewhere else, however you will be responsible any additional costs above what it would have cost to move your entire weight allowance to your Home of Record (HOR) or to your Place Entering Active Duty (PLEAD).</p>
        <p><strong>For retirees or separatees with more than 8 years of continuous active duty:</strong> The government will cover the cost of relocating you to your Home of Selection (HOS), anywhere within the United States.</p>
        <p>You can still move outside the United States, however you will be responsible for any additional costs above what it would have cost to move you within the contiguous 48-states. To determine the government cost, the Personal Property Office typically uses the cost of transporting your entire weight allowance to the farthest possible location within the 48-contiguous states from your current station to calculate the government's maximum liability.</p>

        <h4>Extensions<h4>
      </div>
      <div class="usa-width-three-fourths">
        <p>If you cannot make your separation or retirement move within the designated time frame, you can request an extension (usually via email) from your branch of service. <strong>Time limit extensions can not extend the amount of time you can use <%= abbr_tag('nts') %> or <%= abbr_tag('sit') %>.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Extensions are granted for the following reasons (extensions cannot be granted for convenience or personal preferences):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical treatment: The service member is undergoing hospitalization or receiving medical treatment.</li>
          <li>Education or training: The service member is undergoing education or training.</li>
          <li>Other worthy causes: Specific hardship situations, legal or administrative proceedings that preclude the service member from moving within the time limit, unexpected events such as delay in selling/renovating/construction of a new home, or any delay necessitated as a result of separating/retirement from the service.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each branch of service has slight variations regarding the process and maximum amount of time that extensions can be granted for. Generally, separatees with less than 8 years of service can request extensions in 180-day intervals, for no longer than 3 years, while retirees and separatees with over 8 years of experience can request annual (1-year) extensions, for up to 6 years.</p>

        <p>Select your branch of service to check the specific requirements:</p>

        <p><strong>Long term storage (NTS) at origin</strong> (the location where you were last stationed) for up to 180 days. If you have not scheduled your delivery before your 180 days expires, you will be personally responsible for any additional storage costs.</p>
        <div class="centered">OR</div>
        <p><strong>Short term storage (SIT)</strong> at your destination up to 90 days. If your household goods aren't delivered before the 90 days expires, you will be responsible for the very expensive excess storage costs and you may be ineligible to file any claims within the government Military Claims Office.</p>

      <div class="usa-width-three-fourths">
        <p>If you were living on base, and your housing agreement requires you to move out of government quarters before you can determine your Home of Selection (HOS) you are authorized a short distance <%= abbr_tag('hhg') %> move from the government quarters to a local temporary residence in the vicinity of the vacated quarters. The usual rank-based weight limits do not apply to this "local move" out of government quarters. This local move does not count as your retirement move, but you will need to obtain proper authorization/funding for the move (i.e. Memo, Letter, Order etc), which varies by your service branch. For example, the Air Force will only need your separation and/or retirement order to arrange the local move, where as the Army requires you to obtain a memo from the garrison housing office providing the funding citation to be used for the move. If you have any questions, your <%= link_to 'local personal property office', offices_path %> can help you figure out what the right steps are.</p>

        <strong>Local moves must take place within a 30-mile radius from your base.</strong>
