      Moving outside the continental U.S. (OCONUS) can be intimidating, especially to those who may be experiencing this for the first time. You have resources at your <%= link_to 'local personal property office', offices_path %>, 24/7 at  <%= link_to 'Military OneSource', 'https://www.militaryonesource.mil/web/mos/moving-housing' %>, and in this list of <%= link_to 'moving tips', page_path('moving-guide/tips') %> or <%= link_to 'FAQ', faqs_path %>. Let's check out what a typical <%= abbr_tag('oconus') %> move could look like.
    </div>

    <div id="assignment" class="what-to-expect-section">
      <h4>Assignment Notification</h4>

      <p>Your move process begins with assignment notification, through email, a phone call, or notification from a supervisor. It's important to understand that an assignment notification does not mean that you have "orders" just yet.</p>
      <p>At this stage, you should start looking into places to live near or on your new post and getting everything organized for the pending move. Don't make any permanent decisions (i.e. home purchase) until there are orders in hand.</p>
      <p>Your new location's <%= link_to 'Housing Office', offices_path %> is the best resource for up-to-date weight allowance restrictions and housing options.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="orders" class="what-to-expect-section">
      <h4>Orders</h4>

      <p><strong><em>Accuracy Matters</em></strong> When you receive your orders, make sure all the details are accurate. In addition to the administrative details (your name, social security number, etc.), make sure it has the correct duty station, dependent information, and reporting dates. Let the administration section know that there is an error so it can be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Moving with family?</em></strong> Check to see if dependents are specifically listed in your orders. If not, you'll need to get Command Sponsorship, also known as "Accompanied Orders". You can submit a formal request for "Accompanied Orders" through your chain of command, but be aware that getting your command's approval isn't guaranteed.</p>
      <div class="usa-grid-full">
        <div class="usa-width-one-half">
          <p>Command Sponsorship Benefits:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reimbursed for dependent travel and housing expenses, so keep detailed records!</li>
            <li>More housing allowance</li>
            <li>Higher weight entitlement to move your household goods</li>
            <li>Your dependents will have access to medical and legal services</li>
            <li>The right to stay in your host country without a visa, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="usa-width-one-half">
          <p>Without Sponsorship:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dependent expenses are out of pocket</li>
            <li>Your BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) is affected</li>
            <li>Your family won't automatically have the right to live with you in your new location</li>
            <li>They might need visas</li>
            <li>Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, associated with the country where you will be living. Failure to do so could result in large fines.</li>

    </div>

    <div id="scheduling" class="what-to-expect-section">
      <h4>Schedule Your Move</h4>

      <p>1.) Use the <%= link_to 'Defense Personal Property System', 'https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ETASSOPortal/default.aspx' %> to upload your orders and create a shipment (or two). Check out these <%= link_to 'tutorials', tutorials_path %> for help using <%= abbr_tag('dps') %>.</p>
      <p>2.) Next, take the DD forms generated by <%= abbr_tag('oconus') %> to your local <%= link_to 'Transportation Office', offices_path %>.

                <li>The pick-up date is the day your items are placed on the truck. Your pack dates will be the days leading up to your pick-up date. Those fluctuate depending on your estimated weight.</li>

      <h4>Before the Packers Arrive</h4>

      <p>Your moving company will complete a <strong>Pre-Move Survey</strong> at your home. They'll do a weight estimate and identify any special items that you entered in the Defense Personal Property System (DPS), so that on moving day, they have all the necessary packing materials. Call your moving company if you're within a week of moving day, and a Pre-Move Survey has not been completed on your home. Your <%= link_to 'local personal property office', offices_path %> can also help.</p>

        <strong><em>What should I bring?</em></strong><br>
        Now is the time to take a look at your belongings and decide what to take with you, what you might leave behind in storage, and what items you could sell, or donate. When making this decision, consider:

              <strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Research your host country's electrical outlets! You may need a converter, or choose to buy new appliances and electronics when you get there. Most bases have a thrift shop, where you can pick up items when you arrive!

      <p>Financially speaking, a good understanding of your host country's housing allowances will help you determine what to pack as well. Confirm your new location's Housing Allowance through the Defense Travel Management Office, as these rates can change every year!</p>
    </div>

    <div id="pack-day" class="what-to-expect-section">
      <h4>Packing Day</h4>

      <p>Your packing day and moving dates are not the same thing. On packing day, the moving company sends a team of packers to your home and puts all your items into boxes, usually as fast as possible. The day your boxed are loaded onto the truck for Moving Day could be several days later.</p>

      <p>The packers are supposed to call ahead of time to inform you they will be coming out on certain dates and within a specified time period. It's critical that you are available during this time and for some reason if they fail to show during the window that you, notify your <%= link_to 'local personal property office', offices_path %> quickly.</p>

      <div class="usa-grid-full">
        <div class="usa-width-one-third">
          <p>A team of packers will load just about anything and everything that they can fit into boxes, which means there's a risk that important items may get packed up unintentionally.</p>
          <p><strong><em>How should I pack?</em></strong><br>
          Pack your belongings with unpacking in mind. Where do you want these boxes to go in your new place? The master bedroom, living room, or kitchen? When you move OCONUS, there can be a language barrier between you and your movers in the new host country.</p>

              <strong>Pro-Tips:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Physically separate</strong> anything you plan to take/keep with you from the rest of your belongings into a closet or your vehicle before the packers arrive. Clearly mark this area with a "Do Not Pack" sign.</li>
                <li><strong>Invite friends and family</strong> to keep an eye on things during packing day. It can be really helpful if you can have someone shadowing the packers, making sure your inventory is accurate, potentially even taking photos of the inside of boxes as they are packed.</li>
                <li><strong>Label your boxes</strong> with a small piece of duct tape, each room with its own color. Others have found it helpful to number each room when you arrive in your host country, so that your movers know that the master bedroom is 1, the kitchen 2, and the living room 3.</li>

    </div>

    <div id="moving-day" class="what-to-expect-section">
      <h4>Loading/Moving Day</h4>

      <p>On moving day, the driver of the truck is usually in charge of the show.  They are responsible for ensuring there is a crew and that everything is properly loaded onto the truck before departing. If you run into any issues during this phase, talk with the driver first and if they are unable to resolve the issue don’t hesitate to call your <%= link_to 'local personal property office', offices_path %> for help.</p>
      <p>The transportation company will be creating an inventory of all your household items and will put stickers on all the boxes and larger items (couches, large appliances, etc.).  On these inventory sheets, they will also be indicating whether or not there was any pre-existing damage to your household goods. If you disagree with their assessment make sure you annotate that on the inventory sheet!</p>

          <strong>Pro-Tips:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Do a walkthrough with the driver to make sure everything is out of your residence and loaded up.  This will ensure that nothing gets left behind and if you see any damage to the residence you can annotate that on the forms provided.</li>
            <li>Ask the driver for their phone number so you can reach them if needed.</li>
            <li>If you don’t agree with something on that inventory form make sure you annotate that BEFORE signing in the remarks section!</li>

    </div>

    <div id="getting-there" class="what-to-expect-section">
      <h4>Getting There</h4>
      <p>All your bags are packed, and you’re ready to go? Even if you’re taking a military flight, make sure everyone in your family has a valid passport, unless you’re headed to Hawaii or Alaska. Family members not listed on the Orders may need visas. Don’t forget to pack your important files in your carry-on, along with things like a change of clothes, and medications. The long haul flight will be more comfortable with personal items like books or electronics, snacks, and water to keep hydrated. In your checked bags, pack items for immediate use, like clothes, shoes, and toiletries.</p>

      <p>When you arrive, expect a few in-processing steps. Depending on your host country, this could include briefings at different offices, and trips to different bases, immediately upon arrival. <%= link_to 'Transportation Office Locator', offices_path %></p>

      <p>During your travel keep any receipts of your out of pocket expenses,  things like hotel receipts, rental car, gasoline, tolls, etc. that may be needed when you file your voucher at the end.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="pets" class="what-to-expect-section">
      <h4>Traveling with Pets</h4>

      <p>First, research your new destination’s rules and regulations about bringing pets. Start by contacting your <%= link_to 'local transportation office', offices_path %> to see if there are any breed restrictions, quarantine requirements, and timeline for vaccinations. Check the <%= link_to 'Defense Travel’s Pet site', 'http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/faqpet.cfm' %> for more information.</p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Will my pet's expenses be reimbursed?</em></strong><br>
        For uniformed members on a PCS move, mandatory pet quarantine fees are reimbursable up to $550 per move. This is for dogs and cats only. There is no reimbursement for transportation fees, like airplane tickets, pet-friendly hotels, or kennels.
      </p>

      <p>For civilian employees, pet quarantine fees and transportation charges are included in the Miscellaneous Expense Allowance (MEA) you receive. If MEA expenses are itemized, reimbursement for those expenses, including pet quarantine fees and transportation charges, is allowed up to the applicable maximum amount authorized (JTR, par. 5818-D). Only quarantine and transportation costs associated with dogs, cats and other house pets are included. Other animals (horse, fish, birds, rodents, etc.) are excluded.</p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>How are my pets going to get there?</em></strong><br>
        During the summer months, most airlines won’t ship pets due to the heat, therefore it may be wise to let them stay with friends or family. You could send them home in advance or bring them to your new location after the temperatures have cooled down. Plus, you may be eligible to ship your pets via the <%= link_to 'Patriot Express Air Mobility Command Flight', 'http://www.amc.af.mil/Portals/12/Users/032/88/288/pet_brochure_may_2017[1].pdf?ver=2017-05-02-152244-670' %>.

If your sponsor or organization is not available, reach out to the <%= link_to 'Transportation Office', offices_path %> and they can help coordinate for someone to meet you at the airport to ensure you know where to get settled.</p>

      <p>Finally, you have a couple of options during the delivery phase about what items you want the delivery crew to unpack.</p>

      <ul>
	      <li>A full unpack: Movers empty the boxes of all their contents into the specified rooms.</li>
	      <li>A partial unpack: Movers only open boxes in select areas.</li>
        <li>Movers reassemble furniture that they took apart at the origin (beds, couches, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Clean Up, Claims &amp; Customer Survey</h4>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Clean-Up</em></strong><br>
        Once you have emptied out all your household goods from the boxes, call the local moving company and setup a time for them to come back out and remove any old boxes, packing material, etc. They are responsible to remove it from the residence one time after delivery.
      </p>
      <p>Save time by piling up all the boxes and moving supplies in one location!</p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Claims</em></strong><br>
        While we hope all of your items arrived in one piece, the reality is that isn’t always the case. Sign into <%= link_to 'Defense Personal Property System', 'https://eta.sddc.army.mil/ETASSOPortal/default.aspx' %> and complete this part of the process.  When you login to the system, you can expect to see two paths - Lost/Damage Report and Claims Submission.
      </p>

      <p>A <strong>Loss/Damage Report</strong> is your way to notify the moving company that some of your items are missing or were damaged during the delivery process. <strong>This must be done within 75 days of your delivery date</strong>. If the items cannot be found or they cannot fix the damage, you must file a claim to be reimbursed! Remember... a Loss/Damage Report is NOT a claim!</p>

      <p>If you did not submit a Loss/Damage Report, you will need to file your claim within 75 days of delivery. If you submitted a Loss/Damage Report within the 75 day window, you will have up to 9 months to file a claim for the Full Replacement Value of the item you are claiming. If the claim is filed more than 9 months from the delivery date, you will only be eligible for depreciated value up to two years from delivery.</p>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Customer Satisfaction Survey</em></strong><br>
        The survey asks some questions about your experience is read by actual humans! Be upfront and honest in your feedback, because if there is a negative trend on a moving company they can be suspended temporarily or indefinitely if they are providing poor service. On the flip side, if you find a moving company that did an excellent job, please put that in the survey as well to help out your colleagues!
