    <h2 id="your-orders">Understand Your Orders</h2>

    <p>In general, your moving process will start with the job/travel order’s you recieve from your service. In your orders, information describing your rank, the duration of your job/training, and your assigned location will determine if your entire dependent family can come, what you are allowed to bring, and how those items will arrive to your new location. If you have any questions, your local personal property office is the place to go for help deciphering your orders as they pertain to moving.</p>
    <p><b>Permanent Duty Station (PCS)</b> is when you are assigned to a location for 20+ weeks, regardless of whether your assignment pertains to training or a new job. In these circumstances, you should be allowed a full household move should you choose to take it.</p>
    <p><b>Temporary Duty Yonder (TDY)</b> is when you are temporarily assigned to a new location, for generally less than 20 weeks. For <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %>, it is common that only a small subset of your household belonging will be able to travel with you to your new location.  What to expect for a <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %> move?</p>

    <h2 id="location-matters">Location Matters</h2>

    <p>When you are moving for a <b>Permanent Change of Station (PCS)</b> or a <b>Temporary Duty Yonder (TDY)</b> with the military, the way your household goods get transported from “Point A” to “Point B” largely depends on your rank and whether your entire move will happen within the 48 contiguous states or internationally (including Alaska &amp; Hawaii).</p>

    <%# TODO Add icons and convert to media blocks %>

    <h3><%= abbr_tag('conus') %> (48 Contiguous States)</h3>

    <p><%= abbr_tag('conus') %> are moves that start and end within the 48 contiguous states of the US. Most moves in the US Military are <%= abbr_tag('conus') %> moves.</p>
    <p><%= link_to raw("What to expect for a #{abbr_tag('conus')} move?"), page_path('moving-guide/conus') %></p>

    <h3><%= abbr_tag('oconus') %> (International + Hawaii &amp; Alaska)</h3>

    <p>Moves to or from Alaska and Hawaii along with international stations are considered <%= abbr_tag('oconus') %> moves. These moves are more complicated and each location may have additional limitations on what you are allowed to transport.</p>
    <p><%= link_to raw("What to expect for a #{abbr_tag('oconus')} Move?"), page_path('moving-guide/oconus') %></p>

    <h2 id="move-types">Know Your Options (Move Types)</h2>

    <p>Once you have figured out the type of move (<%= abbr_tag('pcs') %> or <%= abbr_tag('tdy') %>) and your move location (<%= abbr_tag('conus') %> or <%= abbr_tag('oconus') %>), you will have some choices to make regarding how your belongings are shipped to your new destination. Remember, you can split up your total allowable weight into multiple shipments. For example, most service members doing a <%= abbr_tag('pcs') %> <%= abbr_tag('conus') %> move will have both a <%= abbr_tag('ppm') %> (“do it yourself”) shipment of their prized, valuable possessions and a <%= abbr_tag('hhg') %> shipment (“Household Goods Move” using a government-furnished moving company) for the bulk of their belongings.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, your local personal property office is the place to go for help figuring out how to break up your weight into various shipments.</p>

            <p>The government will pay you 95% of their cost to hire a moving company on your behalf. If you can move your belongings yourself for less money, you get to keep the difference.</p>
            <p><%= abbr_tag('ppm') %>s are especially recommended for any irreplaceable valuables you own (i.e. family heirlooms, photos, important documents, etc.) or for necessities you will need immediately at your new location while waiting for your transporter to arrive.</p>

In some cases, service members may be able to get a waiver to allow for vehicle shipment if a medical condition prevents them from sitting for long distances or if the report date makes it geographically impossible to drive with the alloted period of time.</p>
