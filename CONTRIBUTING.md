# Contributing to move.mil

Anyone is welcome to contribute code changes and additions to this project. If you'd like your changes merged into the master branch, please read the following document before opening a [pull request][pulls].

There are several ways in which you can help improve this project:

1. Fix an existing [issue][issues] and submit a [pull request][pulls].
1. Review open [pull requests][pulls].
1. Report a new [issue][issues]. _Only do this after you've made sure the behavior or problem you're observing isn't already documented in an open issue._

## Getting Started

move.mil is a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) (version 5.1.2) application with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) database (version 9.6.3). Development dependencies are managed using the [Bundler](http://bundler.io) gem.

If you're using macOS, you can use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com) to quickly get PostgreSQL installed and running. You may also install PostgreSQL using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

If you're using Homebrew, consider installing [Homebrew Services](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services) to easily start and stop PostgreSQL:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/services
brew services run postgresql
```

This project uses Ruby (version 2.3.4) which can be installed using a Ruby version manager like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

```sh
rbenv install 2.3.4
```

Once you've installed Ruby 2.3.4, install the Bundler gem:

```sh
gem install bundler
```

With your PostgreSQL server started, run the following setup script from the root of the project:

```sh
bin/setup
```

This script will install the dependencies specified in the project's [Gemfile][gemfile], copy sample configuration files, and create and migrate the application's databases.

**Note:** If you're using Postgres.app, `bin/setup` may initially fail owing to a database connection problem. If this happens, update `config/database.yml` to include `host: localhost` in the `default:` section and re-run `bin/setup`.

When the setup script has finished, review and update the following files to match your environment:

- `config/database.yml`
- `config/secrets.yml`

**Note:** You can run `bin/rails secret` to generate values for the `secret_key_base` keys in `config/secrets.yml`.

Lastly, start the application by running `bin/rails server` and opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your Web browser of choice.

## Making Changes

1. Fork and clone the project's repo.
1. Install development dependencies as outlined above.
1. Create a feature branch for the code changes you're looking to make: `git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name origin/master`.
1. _Write some code!_
1. Run the application and verify that your changes function as intended: `bin/rails server`.
1. If your changes would benefit from testing, add the necessary tests and verify everything passes by running `bin/rake spec`.
1. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some new feature or fix some issue'`. _(See [this excellent article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for tips on writing useful Git commit messages.)_
1. Push the branch to your fork: `git push -u origin your-descriptive-branch-name`.
1. Create a new pull request and we'll review your changes.

### Verifying Changes

We use a number of tools to evaluate the quality and security of this project's code:

- The test suite uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info) (`bin/rails`).
- Static code analysis uses [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) (`bin/rubocop`).
- Static vulnerability scans use [Brakeman](http://brakemanscanner.org) (`bin/brakeman`).

Before submitting a [pull request][pulls], use the above tools to verify your changes.

## Code Style

Code formatting conventions are defined in the `.editorconfig` file which uses the [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) syntax. There are [plugins for a variety of editors](http://editorconfig.org/#download) that utilize the settings in the `.editorconfig` file. It is recommended that you install the EditorConfig plugin for your editor of choice.

Your bug fix or feature addition won't be rejected if it runs afoul of any (or all) of these guidelines, but following the guidelines will definitely make everyone's lives a little easier.

## Legalese
